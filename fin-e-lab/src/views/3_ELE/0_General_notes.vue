        ELE = ELEMENTS designed by subcontractor (not in our office).<br>
        Mostly information is presented by drawing (sometimes IFC).<br>
        Modeler must check elements drawing, for clarifying situation with support for our elements.<br>
        ELE elements could be different from RAK solutions, in that case Modeler should adjust elements      according to the ELE drawings.
